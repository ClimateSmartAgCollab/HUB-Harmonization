# Schema Library

Welcome to the [Schema library](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/HUB-Harmonization/) for the Data Hub project.

This is a library of active schema projects. As the projects are updated, documentation may be refined to reflect the contents.

Since we are working within GitHub, please note that the complete history of changes is available using GitHub Commit history tools.

## To add your schemas to the Library

With data that you have or intend to collect, describe your data using the [Semantic Engine](https://www.semanticengine.org). You will download a .zip version of your schema which is a machine-readable version. Then on the main page of the Semantic Engine drag-and-drop your schema and generate a markdown version. Be sure to select the Data Hub and enter in the correct ICT Team as this information will sort your schema into the right menu item in the [Schema library](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/HUB-Harmonization/).

In [Data Harmonization GitHub repository](https://github.com/ClimateSmartAgCollab/HUB-Harmonization), upload your markdown file (which you can rename) to the schema folder.


After you have made your file changes, commit your changes and wait for the documentation site to rebuild before viewing your results on the [Schema library](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/HUB-Harmonization/).

Learn the GitHub skills to perform this work on our [Documentation site](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/Documentation-en/github/).
