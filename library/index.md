# Schema Library

Welcome to the [Schema library](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/HUB-Harmonization/) for the Data Hub project. View and search schemas in the [Schema library](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/HUB-Harmonization/) amd contribute your schemas here on the GitHub backend. 

These is a library of active schema projects and so as documentation is refined the contents will change.

Because this work is all done within GitHub, the complete history of changes is available using GitHub Commit history tools.

## Add to the Library

Write your schema using the [Semantic Engine](https://www.semanticengine.org).

Generate a markdown version of your schema.

Copy your schema markdown file into the folder Schemas.

Learn the GitHub skills to perform this work on our [Documentation site](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/Documentation/github/).
