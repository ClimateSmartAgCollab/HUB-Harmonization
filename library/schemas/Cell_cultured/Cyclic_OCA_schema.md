**Name**: Cyclic Voltammetry for Lactate Detection  
**Description**: This schema will have table of Voltage and current for different number of scans. On plotting the data and identifying the peaks characteristic to Lactate, the voltage can be determined which would be the input to Lactate conversion study using chronoamperometry.
