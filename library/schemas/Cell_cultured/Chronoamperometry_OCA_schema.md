**Name**: Chronoamperometry for Lactate Conversion  
**Description**: This schema will have a table of current and time. On plotting this, we can identify any reduction in analyte concentration from the gradual decline(here, Lactate). Required Time periods for conversion can be input and current would be read correspondingly by the instrument.
