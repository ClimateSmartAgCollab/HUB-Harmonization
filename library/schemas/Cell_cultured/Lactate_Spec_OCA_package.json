Absorbance of Blank wells are initially taken and subtracted from Absorbance values obtained by adding samples at that particular wavelength. Reference is considered as the absorbance of sample with 0 concentration of L-Lactic acid and is subtracted from sample absorbance to get the actual absorbance. Based on the obtained values of actual absorbance, the concentration of L-Lactic acid is determined in samples from the calibration curve.","name":"Lactate Quantification using Spectrophotometry"}],"unit":{"d":"ED4_CG14kJu6An3QWyJvFNbA51rbIFPa65J2RjN4Ybrt","capture_base":"EKBXsHpJvMOnTuE7kTQmwz6dPgr_rTwjIAZFN-wEodal","type":"spec/overlays/unit/1.1","attribute_unit":{"Absorbance_Blankwell":"OD","Absorbance_Reference":"OD","Absorbance_Sample":"OD","Absorbance_SampleandBlankwell":"OD","ActualAbsorbance_Sample":"OD","Concentration_Average":"mM","Concentration_Calculated":"mM","Concentration_StandardDeviation":"mM"}}}},"dependencies":[]},"extensions":{"adc":{"EKBXsHpJvMOnTuE7kTQmwz6dPgr_rTwjIAZFN-wEodal":{"d":"ECZGEPV6T_FMz8_zlRWwavHdcxM8fdRWwdmlNUQ9SPoU","type":"community/adc/extension/1.0","overlays":{"ordering":{"d":"EI284arOaNiADLKo5gyo69qiNrSk96ZgZ_FaXW1C0l2V","type":"community/overlays/adc/ordering/1.1","attribute_ordering":["SampleDescription","Absorbance_Blankwell","Absorbance_SampleandBlankwell","Absorbance_Sample","Absorbance_Reference","ActualAbsorbance_Sample","Concentration_Calculated","Concentration_Average","Concentration_StandardDeviation"],"entry_code_ordering":{}}}}}}}
