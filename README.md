# Harmonization HUB

The Harmonization HUB is a place for researchers to share and develop their data documentation to ultimately improve data interoperability.

Why GitHub?
GitHub offers our project several advantages. It has built in discussion, wiki and issue tracking which helps manage the project and collaborate on shared schemas. GitHub is free to use and widely used, any resources that are developed here can be freely copied and moved by ICT teams so that their work can remain available rather than locked to specific infrastructure. GitHub also supports version tracking where every change is recorded. If necessary we can undo any changes in case of mistakes and we can track contributions of the team members.

## Harmonization HUB structure

* **Folder data_standards**: Work on harmonizing data by the creation of new standards is done in this folder.
* **Discussions**: Use the built in Discussions to connect with the community.

# First steps
* Bookmark the [learning site](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/Documentation/) which will be continually updated with new information.
* Participate in a GitHub discussion, ask your colleagues questions, request help with data schemas.
* Document data you are generating using the [Semantic Engine](https://www.semanticengine.org). Put these schemas (finished or in progress) in your ICT_Team folder for other Harmonization HUB members to view.
* Discover what data other teams are collecting - browse the ICT_Team folders to read data documentation.
* See an opportunity for similar data collection? Add it to the discussions. The Data Hub will help with data standards development.
* New standards will be supported by the Data Harmonizer in the future as they are developed.

# Harmonization HUB discussions
![GitHub discussions link](https://github.com/ClimateSmartAgCollab/HUB-Harmonization/blob/main/assets/GitHub_discussions.png)

In [discussions](https://github.com/ClimateSmartAgCollab/HUB-Harmonization/discussions) you can ask the community for recommendations and suggestions for all things related to data standards such as which standards to recommend, which ontologies to use, how to document data and more. Start a new discussion in the relevant category to begin connecting with your colleagues.

The discussions board will also be where we will discuss the creation of new standards to be used by the community based on their data harmonization needs.

# Harmonization Hub outputs

* Shared knowledge and skill building.
* Development of new standards for data harmonization.
