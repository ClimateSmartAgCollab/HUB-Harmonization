# Harmonization HUB

The Harmonization HUB is a place for researchers to share and develop their data documentation to ultimately improve data interoperability.

Why GitHub?
GitHub offers our project several advantages. It has built in discussion, wiki and issue tracking which helps manage the project and collaborate on shared schemas. GitHub is free to use and widely used, any resources that are developed here can be freely copied and moved by ICT teams so that their work can remain available rather than locked to specific infrastructure. GitHub also supports version tracking where every change is recorded. If necessary we can undo any changes in case of mistakes and we can track contributions of the team members.

# First steps
* Bookmark the learning site which will be continually updated with new information.
* Participate in a discussion, ask your colleagues questions, request help with data schemas.
* Document data you are generating using the Semantic Engine. Put these schemas (finished or in progress) in your ICT_Team folder.
* Discover what data other teams are collecting - browse the ICT_Team folders to read data documentation.
* See an opportunity for similar data collection? Add it to the discussions. The Data Hub will help with data standards development.
* New standards will be supported by the Data Harmonizer.

# Harmonization Hub outputs

* Shared knowledge and skill building.
* Development of new standards for data harmonization.
