# Harmonization HUB

The Harmonization HUB is a place for researchers to share and develop their data documentation to ultimately improve data interoperability.

Why GitHub?
GitHub offers our project several advantages. It has built in history recording, discussion forums and issue tracking which helps manage the project and collaborate on shared schemas. GitHub is free to use and widely used, any resources that are developed here can be freely copied and moved by ICT teams so that their work can remain available rather than locked to specific infrastructure. GitHub supports version tracking where every change is recorded. If necessary we can undo any changes in case of mistakes and we can track contributions of the team members.

## Harmonization HUB structure

* **Folder data_standards**: Work on harmonizing data by the creation of new standards is done in this folder.
* **Library**: markdown versions of schemas created using the [Semantic Engine](https://www.semanticengine.org) can be saved here to appear in the [Schema library](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/HUB-Harmonization/).

## Get help with GitHub
* [Beginners guide to GitHub](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/Documentation-en/github/) is specifically written for an introduction to GitHub for people who aren't necessarily coding.

# First steps
* Bookmark the [learning site](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/Documentation/) which will be continually updated with new information.
* Participate in a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateSmartAgCollab/discussions), ask your colleagues questions, request help with data schemas. You must be a member of this GitHub organization to see the discussions.
* Document data you are generating using the [Semantic Engine](https://www.semanticengine.org). Publish these schemas in the [Schema library](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/HUB-Harmonization/).
* Discover what data other teams are collecting - browse the [Schema library](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/HUB-Harmonization/).
* See an opportunity for similar data collection? Add it to the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateSmartAgCollab/discussions). The Data Hub will help with data standards development.
* New standards will be supported by the [Data Harmonizer](https://github.com/cidgoh/DataHarmonizer) in the future as they are developed.

# Harmonization HUB discussions

In [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateSmartAgCollab/discussions) you can ask the community for recommendations and suggestions for all things related to data standards such as which standards to recommend, which ontologies to use, how to document data and more. Start a new discussion in the relevant category to begin connecting with your colleagues. You must be a member of this GitHub organization to see the discussions.

The discussions board will also be where we will discuss the creation of new standards to be used by the community based on their data harmonization needs.

# Harmonization Hub outputs

* Shared knowledge and skill building.
* Searchable library of data being collected by ICTs.
* Development of new standards for data harmonization.
